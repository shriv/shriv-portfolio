summary:
abstract:"Walkability can be measured in many ways but a simple proxy of local walkability is the distance (and travel time) to a nearby amenity - like the local playground. Using geospatial network analysis, we can "walk" to many parks (from anywhere) and learn about how walkable our cities and towns really are."
